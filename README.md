## 🧐 About
This is an implementation of a function that handles and prints different data types.

The function will do the following conversions:
* %c print a single character.
* %s print a string of characters.
* %p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
* %d print a decimal (base 10) number.
* %i print an integer in base 10.
* %u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
* %x print a number in hexadecimal (base 16).
* %% print a percent sign.

The function returns:
* The number of characters printed (excluding the null byte).

Prototype: 
* `int	ft_printf(const char *format, ...)`

This project is part of 42 École/ 42 SP curriculum.\
Topics such as variadic functions and data types manipulation were addressed.

## 🏁 Getting Started
The `gcc` compiler is needed.

#### ⚙️ Installing
To compile the code, clone the repo, and run the command `make`.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/filipebafica/ft_printf.git
$ cd ft_printf
$ make
```
This is going to generate a `ft_printf.a` file that you can compile with your source code.
```
$ gcc my_source.c -I ./ft_printf/includes ./ft_printf/ft_printf.a
$ ./a.out
```
## 🎈 How to Use
Call the function passing a string and specifiers as seen below:
```
#include "ft_printf.h"

int	main(void)
{
	char	*var;

	var = "Hello World";
	ft_printf("Print this: %s\n", var);
	return (0);
}
```
